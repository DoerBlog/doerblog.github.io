## About me

Baihan Lin
University of Washington

Code life with design~
生物狗，程序猿，设计狮  

Computational Biology is my theme.  
Other than that, I read, play flute and bad guitar.  
I love hiking, badminton, table tennis, swimming and kayaking.  

## About this blog

This is an **outdated** experimental blog with updates of my life, supplemental to my another **outdated** official homepage: [http://doerlbh.github.io](http://doerlbh.github.io). My latest official website is at [http://www.columbia.edu/~bl2681/](http://www.columbia.edu/~bl2681/).

I tends to like classifying and arranging everything in order and this style of layouts facilitates that greatly.  

In a society of fast speed, ironically a virtual room becomes the most stable place to keep knowledge and thoughts than ever before.   

Thus, I would like to give it a try.  

## Acknowledgement  

This blog used [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) and hosted in my [Github](https://github.com/DoerBlog/doerblog.github.io), with a theme modified upon [3-Jekyll](https://github.com/P233/3-Jekyll) and [suyan](https://github.com/suyan/suyan.github.io). Here I really appreciate the wonderful designs and platforms from brilliant authors for above projects.
